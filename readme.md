# Smalltest - Minimal python unittest convenience #

An attempt to make a minimal python unittest runner designed to allow for simple
pytest style test writing without requiring any dependencies outside of the 
stdlib.


The core features this intends to support are:
   1. Writing tests as plain `test_this` named functions without the need for `unittest.TestCase`
      classes. 🗹
   2. Getting useful information from plain `assert` statements to remove the need for 
      assertXYZ style functions. ☐
   3. Some basic decorators to provide xfail/skipif/parametrized tests. 🗹🗹☐
